# URLCompress
Simple compressor for feed URLs

This program is intended as a companion to another project (currently in concept stages) that will reprocess RSS feeds so as to condense multiple items into a single entry. This program turns query parameters into shorter tokens (in *a* base-64 encoding) so that the user may have a shorter URL for their output without relying on the server saving their preferences.
